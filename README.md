PHOTOSTICKER APPLICATION

The `index.html` is the landing page. It will appreciated if you try app under `localhost`, otherwise it will trigger some error as "Cross origin requests not allowed".
I think, the firefox doesn't have Cross origin issue.

Sample Localhost URL : http://localhost:3000/PhotoSticker/index.html
The port(3000) can be anything according to server.
