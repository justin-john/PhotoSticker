# PHOTOSTICKER APPLICATION

An app which upload an image and stickers. These stickers can be dragged and put in the Image.
## Run

The `index.html` is the landing page. It will appreciated if you try app under `localhost`, otherwise it will trigger some error as "Cross origin requests not allowed".
I think, the firefox doesn't have Cross origin issue.

Sample Localhost URL : http://localhost:3000/PhotoSticker/index.html
The port(3000) can be anything according to server.

## Notes

This is experimental application and not fully developed. If you are interested to tweak code, please let know or send a pull request. All our suggestions are welcome.
